    # columns (McRitchie Studio tasks / news / content) and the depth-chart lanes.
    # A record carries an integer `position`; the board renders by `board_ordered`
    # (highest position on top), and a drag-reorder restamps the whole column with
    # 100-gaps via `reposition!`. Ranking is ZONE-SCOPED: a fresh rank is computed
    # within the record's zone (a kanban `stage`, a depth-chart position group), so
    # every column ranks independently and 100-spacing leaves room for the next
    # drag insert without a full re-stamp.
    #
    # This is the read/rank half of the board primitive; the write half is
    # Studio::Board::Reorderable (the controller action that calls reposition!).
