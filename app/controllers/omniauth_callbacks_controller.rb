# Defense-in-depth: omniauth-google-oauth2 already verifies the id_token's JWT
# signature against Google's JWKS, but we additionally re-validate it server-side
# via Google's tokeninfo endpoint (GoogleOauthValidator) to assert audience +
# email_verified + expiry before trusting the identity. Only a Google-confirmed
# verified email is allowed to find-or-create an account.
#
# Engine GENERIC base. turf-monster OVERRIDES this controller for popup-mode,
# account merge, wallet-collision stashing, and funnel attribution.
