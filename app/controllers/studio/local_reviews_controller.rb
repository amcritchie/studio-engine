  # GET /_studio/local_review?email=<who>&return_to=<path> — the LOCAL half of
  # the task board's WAITING APPROVAL button.
  #
  # Why it must live here, on the local app. A magic link signs the recipient
  # into the app that MINTED it: the token is a row (or a signed blob) in that
  # app's own store, and Studio::LinkToken.sanitize_path keeps `return_to` a
  # same-origin PATH. So a link minted by the production board can only ever
  # land on production — no matter what host the path belongs to. The board
  # therefore stops minting and REDIRECTS here, to the local server named by the
  # task's local_url, which mints in its own database and lands the operator
  # signed-in on the page under review.
  #
  # It mints for whatever email it is handed, unauthenticated — so it is bound
  # to the same floor as the local email inbox (Studio::LocalEmailsController):
  # never in production, and only for a loopback request. That is the same
  # exposure the inbox already carries, which hands every captured sign-in link
  # to any local reader. It is a development desk convenience; it is not a
  # sign-in path.
