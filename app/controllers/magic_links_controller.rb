# That is the whole controller. The token-bearing half lives at /l/<token>
# (Studio::LinksController): one token format, one place it burns. Before
# 0.30.0 this class also owned a /magic_link/:token confirm+consume pair for
# the retired :signed store, which was a second door onto the same lock.
#
# create-or-login: clicking the emailed link IS proof of email ownership, so an
# email that collides with a Google/wallet-only account that was never
# email-verified is safely signed in at consume time and stamped
# email_verified_at (unlike from_omniauth, which refuses that collision
# precisely because it lacked this proof).
