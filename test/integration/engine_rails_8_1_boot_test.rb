# Boots studio-engine inside a real Rails app (test/dummy) and exercises the
# engine's Rails-version-sensitive surfaces — the Railtie, Zeitwerk autoload
# wiring, the route DSL, and the ActiveRecord models (ErrorLog + the Sluggable
# concern on ThemeSetting). This is the "engine vs Rails dummy app" check: when
# the gemspec rails bound is widened, run this against the new Rails line to
# prove the engine still boots and its DB/HTTP surfaces still work.
#
# Scope note: the dummy deliberately autoloads (config.eager_load = false) and
# never references the engine's omniauth / solana controllers, which depend on
# host-app-only gems. Those are covered by the consumer apps' own suites
# (Consumer CI). Here we prove the *self-contained* engine core is Rails-OK.
