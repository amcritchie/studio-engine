# [integration] The magic-link click, driven through the real stack — router →
# Studio::LinksController → Studio::LinkConsumption → session cookie. The
# decision table itself is unit-tested in test/lib/studio/link_resolution_test.rb;
# THIS suite proves the wiring behind it: that the token really burns, that the
# session cookie really survives (or really switches), and that a GET really is
# inert.
#
# It exists because the unit table can be perfectly right while the controller
# still signs the wrong person in — the two failures the operator actually hit
# were both wiring, not logic:
#
#   1. a ~350-character token in the URL
#   2. a second click dumping a signed-in visitor on the login page
#
# Both are asserted here against a real HTTP round trip.
