# Changelog

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Consumer Rails apps install the released RubyGems package with `gem "studio-engine", "~> 0.6"`; bumping the gem version and updating consumer lockfiles is a release.

## Unreleased

**The hub's link sidebar becomes the engine's out-of-the-box navigation.** New
apps get a default navigation surface without forking the navbar: declare
`Studio.sidebar_sections` (a static Array or a callable receiving the view
context; sections flagged `admin: true` show to admins only) and the engine
navbar mounts a trigger in its desktop icon rail and mobile sub-navbar, then
renders the slide-out link panels after the header. The family ships as
`components/_link_sidebar` (dual desktop/mobile panels + the engine-owned
Alpine `sidebars` store bridge, Turbo- and bfcache-safe), the generic
`components/_sidebar_panel` shell, and `components/_link_sidebar_trigger` —
all lifted from the mcritchie-studio hub. `engine.css` gains the
`studio-link-sidebar-layer` stacking utility and the Alpine `[x-cloak]`
pre-init rule. **Upgrade-safe by default:** `sidebar_sections` defaults to
`[]`, which renders nothing — existing consumers see zero change until they
opt in (pinned by `test/integration/sidebar_navbar_render_test.rb`). The
`html { overflow-x: clip }` slide guard ships inside the sidebar partial, not
globally. When the viewer's resolved sections carry an `admin: true` entry,
the sidebar replaces the engine admin dropdown (both use the cog glyph — one
gear, not two); public-only sections keep the dropdown. Resolution rules live
in `lib/studio/sidebar_sections.rb` (pure Ruby, unit-tested); docs in
`NEW_APP_SETUP.md` §4/§13 and `NAVBAR_SETUP.md`.

## 0.29.0 — 2026-07-29

**The four depth-chart gaps folded into the `studio/board` primitive (Phase D), so
the MS depth chart can rebase onto it like `/tasks`, news, and content did.** The
0.28.0 primitive fit the near-identical kanban boards; the depth chart is more
custom — it ranks by a `depth` column (1 = starter) while its `position` column
holds a lane-code string, lays its lanes out in a two-level side→position grid, and
pins locked starters. Each capability is **additive and opt-in — every hook omitted
renders and ranks exactly as 0.28.0**, so `/tasks`, news, and content are untouched.

### Added

- **DG1 — configurable rank column + sort direction** (`Studio::Board::Rankable`):
  `board_rank_attr` (default `:position`) and `board_rank_order` (default `:desc`)
  thread through `board_ordered`, `board_next_position`, `set_initial_position`, and
  `reposition!`. A depth chart sets `board_rank_attr = :depth`, `board_rank_order =
  :asc` (depth 1 on top). The order fragment quotes the column and whitelists the
  ASC/DESC literal — never user input.
- **DG2 — sequential 1..N ranks**: `reposition!(ids, gap: 1, direction: :asc)` stamps
  `1, 2, 3, … N` (the depth numbers) instead of the 100-gapped default.
- **DG3 — two-level side→position grid**: `studio/board/_board` accepts `groups:`
  (`[{ key:, label:, cols_class:, columns: [...] }]`) and renders each group as a
  labelled section whose lanes lay out in a responsive grid; `studio/board/_column`
  gains `layout: "grid"` (drops the flex-row width utilities so the grid cell sizes
  the column). Omit `groups:` for the unchanged flat row.
- **DG4 — per-card lock/pin**: `reposition!(skip_locked: true, lock_attr: :locked)`
  leaves a pinned entry's rank untouched; `Studio::Board::Reorderable` gains the
  matching `board_reorderable(rank_attr:, skip_locked:, lock_attr:)` config plus a
  `board_toggle_lock` action (config-gated, `rescue_and_log(target:)` discipline,
  `{ ok:, locked: }`); `studio/board/_card_shell` accepts `locked: true` (adds
  `.kanban-locked` + `data-locked`); the `studioBoard` factory takes a
  `lockedSelector` opt that filters locked cards from dragging and refuses a move
  that would cross one, so a pinned starter keeps its slot while the rest reflow.
- **`/admin/style`** gains a third live board specimen — the depth-chart shape:
  Offense/Defense sections, position lanes in a grid, within-lane reorder, and 🔒
  pinned starters.

## 0.27.0 — 2026-07-28

**Two coordinated modal flows on the `/admin/style` Design System page — a walked
"Web3 Contest" wallet → on-chain flow and an extended "Contest entry & eligibility"
flow — plus a reusable minimum-visible-duration convention for load modals.** All
specimens are DEMO chrome (`demo: true`, no real signing); the engine gains only
view/chrome primitives and keeps custodial keys, wallet/multisig signing,
`Solana::Config`, and every on-chain write app-side.

### Added

- **Minimum-visible-duration convention** — `studio/modals/_load_convention`
  ships `window.StudioModals.holdAtLeast(minMs)` + a standard
  `MIN_LOAD_MS` (1400) as a SINGLE definition, rendered by both the shared modal
  host (`studio/modals/_host`, which drops its inline copy) and the style page.
  A load spinner holds for at least `min_duration`, longer if the real async runs
  longer — `resolveAt = max(min_duration, actual_completion)`; in demo mode
  `min_duration` doubles as the auto-resolve timer. `_processing_card` gains
  `min_duration` + `resolve_expr` locals so a demo load card self-advances.
- **Web3 Contest** section (renamed from "Web3") — a walked flow with
  glow-follows-the-flow continuity: Connect Wallet → Processing on-chain
  transaction → On-chain success. The Processing card is a load modal with a demo
  success/error toggle (unchecked resolves to success, checked to error), both
  resolved states built. Picking a wallet swaps to Processing, which auto-resolves
  after the min-load duration.
- **Contest entry & eligibility** section (renamed from "Eligibility & entry",
  moved directly under Web3 Contest) — the entry flow extended to
  Entry tokens → Payment processing → Entry Tokens Minted → Contest enter
  processing → Contest entered, with the glow following the step machine. Keeps
  the Age gate + Entry tokens cards. The section states the honest web2/web3 map:
  the token mint is web2-only (web3 funds USDC on-chain directly, no token); the
  paths diverge at the funding front-end and the entry-submit endpoint, then
  converge on the same on-chain Entry PDA and the same "Entry Confirmed" card.

### Changed

- **`studio/modals/_host`** — the `holdAtLeast` helper now lives in the shared
  `_load_convention` partial (same API, byte-identical behavior) so the host and
  the DS page share one definition instead of drifting copies.
- **`style/modals/_entry_tokens`** — the confirming step uses the min-load
  convention instead of a hardcoded timeout, and the step machine gains
  `entering` + `entered` so hold-to-confirm walks through the on-chain consume to
  the shared Entry Confirmed finish.
- **`style/modals/_onchain_tx`** — a processing modal opened with `demoResolve`
  auto-resolves to success (or error when `demoError`) after the min-load
  duration, honoring the convention.
- The Modals-section glow helper discriminates the on-chain-tx `state` and a
  configurable step default, so the glow tracks a walked flow across modal ids.

## 0.26.1 — 2026-07-28

**Fix the `/admin/style` Design System page breaking when reached via Turbo Drive
navigation (the admin sidebar "Design System" link).** Reached by a direct page
load the page was fine; reached by an in-app Turbo visit its modals would not open
on a card click and EVERY specimen glow ring lit at once. Both symptoms were one
cause: the page-scoped `dsModals` (and `dsSolanaModal`) Alpine store was registered
ONLY inside a `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', …)` handler in the page
body. Alpine loads via a deferred CDN `<script>` in the engine head and fires
`alpine:init` exactly once, on the first full-document load; Turbo Drive advance
visits swap `<body>` without reloading that head script, so `alpine:init` never
fires again — and because the registration lives only in the `/admin/style` body,
it was absent during that one `alpine:init`. The specimen cards' `x-data` still
re-initialize on the Turbo body swap (Alpine's MutationObserver), so their
`@click="$store.dsModals.open(…)"`, `:style` glow bindings, and the host's
`<template x-if="$store.dsModals.current()…">` all evaluated against an undefined
store and threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')` — no
modal opened, and the throwing `:style` wiped each card's static inline
`--studio-team-glow-opacity: 0`, so the CSS default of `1` relit all rings.

### Fixed

- **`style/_modals`** — the `dsModals` + `dsSolanaModal` registration is now a
  named `registerDsModals()` invoked through the same dual-guard the engine
  already uses for `studio/modals/_image_upload`'s `cropPhotoModal`:
  `if (window.Alpine) registerDsModals(); else document.addEventListener('alpine:init', registerDsModals);`.
  On a Turbo visit Alpine has already started, so the store registers immediately
  (the body script re-runs on every Turbo render) and `$store.dsModals` is defined
  before the cards' bindings evaluate; on a first load Alpine has not booted yet,
  so it still defers to `alpine:init`. The `if (Alpine.store('dsModals')) return;`
  idempotency guard is unchanged, so a later `alpine:init` is a no-op. No consumer
  change is required — `/admin/style` is an engine page.
- **Docs** — `style/_modal_specimen`'s fail-closed comment now records that the
  static inline `--studio-team-glow-opacity: 0` guards the ring only while
  `$store.dsModals` is DEFINED (a throwing `:style` wipes the inline value) — the
  refinement of 0.24.1's "regardless of Alpine timing" claim that this bug exposed.

### Swept

- Audited every engine `Alpine.store(...)` / `Alpine.data(...)` registration for
  the same Turbo-visit fragility. `dsModals`/`dsSolanaModal` (`style/_modals`) was
  the only page-scoped registration missing the guard. `studio/modals/_image_upload`
  (`cropPhotoModal`) already carries it; the shared modal host (`studio/modals/_host`
  → `modals`) and the theme/devMode stores (`layouts/studio/_head`) are app-wide
  bootstrap rendered on the first full load, so their single `alpine:init`
  registration persists across Turbo visits (verified: `$store.modals` stays
  defined after a Turbo nav).

## 0.26.0 — 2026-07-28

**The engine navbar pins itself under smooth-load, and the smooth-load CSS is
fully engine-owned.** Since 0.24 the `vt-pinned-header` pin was opt-in but the
engine's own `layouts/_navbar` never carried it, so a host that wanted the
pinned-header transition had to SHADOW the whole partial just to add one class
(acquisition-studio did exactly that — the known override-drift trap). The
navbar now self-pins when `Studio.smooth_load` is on, and the engine also ships
the `studio-header` cross-fade suppression that mcritchie-studio and
turf-monster had been carrying app-side as a bridge. **Consumer cleanup this
version unlocks:** acquisition-studio deletes its entire
`app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb` override; mcritchie-studio and
turf-monster delete their app-side `::view-transition-old(studio-header)` /
`::view-transition-new(studio-header) { animation: none; }` bridge blocks.

### Changed

- **`layouts/_navbar`** — the sticky header adds `vt-pinned-header` itself when
  `Studio.smooth_load` is on, non-preview branch ONLY (preview renders can
  repeat per page, and a duplicate `view-transition-name` silently disables
  every transition). With the flag off nothing extra renders, so a plain gem
  bump changes no opted-out app.
- **`engine.css`** — new `::view-transition-old(studio-header)` /
  `::view-transition-new(studio-header) { animation: none; }` rule beside the
  smooth-load block: it suppresses the UA-default ~250ms plus-lighter
  cross-fade between the header's two snapshots, which double-drew the wordmark
  and buttons on any navigation from a scrolled page (collapsed header →
  expanded at top). Lifts the identical bridge rule the hub and turf-monster
  carried app-side.
- **`engine.css`** — `.turbo-progress-bar` background becomes
  `var(--color-cta, #0076ff)`: the fallback (Turbo's own default blue) keeps
  the bar visible in a layout that never renders the runtime theme block
  (`studio_theme_css_tag`), where `--color-cta` is unset.

## 0.25.1 — 2026-07-28

**Fix the Profile Leveling save-close regression 0.25.0 introduced.** The 0.25.0
rebuild made `_finishSaved` ALWAYS advance to the engine's own updated view (the
seeds celebration or the plain confirmation), on the belief that Turf Monster's
live usage was "unaffected." It was not: TM's change-username modal
(`leveling: false`, `saved_event: "studio:username-saved"`) drives its OWN
post-save follow-on — its listener runs `completeQuest` and closes/swaps. With
the engine now also advancing to its own confirm view, the next quest step
("Send Your First Message") rendered TWICE at once — once in the post-save modal
dialog, once in the inline quest card behind it — which TM's Playwright e2e
caught as a strict-mode double-render (`quest_ladder_web2`, `quest_ladder_web3`,
and the web3 step-dedup contract). In 0.24 a `leveling: false` modal rendered no
celebrate view and let the app close it, so the step rendered once.

### Fixed

- **`studio/_leveling_activity_assets`** (factory) — `_finishSaved` now CLOSES on
  save (fires the `saved_event`, then stops — the 0.24 contract) instead of
  advancing to the engine's own confirm/celebrate WHEN the consuming app drives
  its own follow-on. A new `appDrivenFollowOn` getter is that signal: a **non-demo**
  caller that wired its OWN (non-default) `saved_event` owns the after-save UI, so
  the engine yields (it never force-closes — the app's listener owns close-vs-swap,
  which TM relies on: close on the contest page, swap to `quest-success` on
  `/account`). **Demo** previews (`/admin/style`) and **standalone** callers on the
  DEFAULT `saved_event` are unchanged — they still advance to the seeds celebration
  (TM shape) or the plain confirmation (MS shape), and the "Great Username" /
  "Subscribed!" specimen cards still open straight at their celebrate state via
  `props.celebrate`. No consumer change is required; TM's existing wiring restores
  its own contract.



**Profile Leveling** — the `/admin/style` "Leveling activities" section is rebuilt
into a single toggle-driven "Profile Leveling" flow, and the with-leveling /
without-leveling FORK is killed. Previously each activity shipped as TWO modal
ids (`change-username` + `change-username-plain`, `quest-activity` +
`quest-activity-plain`), because the primitive read `leveling` from a Ruby local
at render time. Now the primitive reads `leveling` at RUNTIME from the modal
store's `props.leveling`, so ONE id per activity flips the Turf Monster shape
(the seeds celebration + Free Entry Token progress) ↔ the McRitchie Studio shape
(plain input + Save, then a simple confirmation) live as its per-card leveling
toggle moves.

### Changed

- **`studio/modals/blocks/_leveling_activity`** — three views now, all ALWAYS
  rendered and gated by the reactive `leveling` getter instead of dropped at ERB
  time: the **form** (`!celebrate`), the **seeds celebration**
  (`celebrate && leveling`, TM), and a **plain confirmation**
  (`celebrate && !leveling`, MS). The `leveling` local becomes the render-time
  fallback only. **The "Quest N of N" counter pill is removed** — the profile
  modals do not carry one. **The "Level N" pill is also dropped** from the
  celebration (no consumer used it); the seeds bar stays. All existing seams
  are preserved unchanged (`submit_url`, `finalize_hook`, `saved_event`,
  `modal_store`, `demo`, seeds/level props), so Turf Monster's live usage and the
  opaque save-callback contract are unaffected (TM ships no `props.leveling` and
  keeps its `:leveling`-capability default).
- **`studio/_leveling_activity_assets`** (factory) — `leveling` is a runtime getter
  reading `props.leveling` off the modal store (falling back to `_levelingDefault`);
  an `init` hook opens the modal directly at the updated state via `props.celebrate`
  (the "updated" cards open the same id pre-advanced, like the Auth step cards);
  `_finishSaved` always advances to the updated state (the view gate picks
  celebration vs plain confirmation) AND mirrors `celebrate` onto the live store
  `props.celebrate`, so the active-card **glow follows the flow** — it transfers
  from the input card to the updated card as the modal advances, exactly like the
  Auth glow follows `props.step`. In **demo** mode the app-facing saved event is
  suppressed, so a host app's follow-on handler (e.g. Turf Monster's
  `quest-success` on `studio:username-saved`) can't stack a second modal over the
  demo's own celebrate view.
- **`/admin/style`** — "Leveling activities" → **"Profile Leveling"**: **each
  specimen card carries its OWN `Leveling` toggle** (like the Auth card's method
  checkboxes), flipping THAT card between the Turf Monster and McRitchie Studio
  shape at open — so you can preview Change Username leveling-on beside Great
  Username leveling-off. The section walks **four** cards — **Change Username →
  Great Username**, then **Join the Newsletter → Subscribed!** — each "updated"
  card opening its modal straight at the success state, mirroring Turf Monster's
  real copy, seeds, and Free Entry Token progress. No quest counter, no Level pill.

### Added

- **`_leveling_activity` locals** (all optional, additive): `consent_label` (a
  consent checkbox that gates the action — the newsletter join), `confirm_subtitle`
  (subtext on the MS-shape plain confirmation), `next_label` / `next_open` (a
  "Next Quest" button that walks to the next activity), and `demo_seeds_earned` /
  `demo_seeds_total` (style-guide-only seed payload tuning).

## 0.24.1 — 2026-07-28

Bug fix — the **`/admin/style` specimen glow failed OPEN**. Every glow-capable
specimen card (`style/_modal_specimen`) carries the `.studio-team-glow` class
statically, and the "only the active card glows" behavior rode entirely on a
reactive Alpine `:style` overriding the primitive's CSS default of
`--studio-team-glow-opacity: 1` (visible) down to `0`. Before Alpine hydrates —
or if it never loads — all 13 reactive-glow cards (Auth, Eligibility, Profile,
Leveling) painted their ring at once. The steady state was correct (the glow
follows the step machine), so this surfaced as a flash-of-all-glow on load.

### Fixed

- **`style/_modal_specimen`** now renders a **static inline
  `style="--studio-team-glow-opacity: 0"`** on the glow wrapper beside the
  reactive `:style`, so the ring is OFF at first paint (fail-closed) regardless
  of Alpine timing. The reactive binding still drives `0 ↔ 0.95` with the 0.4s
  cross-fade, so the active-card glow and its slide between step cards are
  unchanged. The `engine-motion.css` `.studio-team-glow` default is untouched
  (the always-on Tricks demos depend on it).

  > **Refined in 0.26.1:** "regardless of Alpine timing" holds only while
  > `$store.dsModals` is defined. On a Turbo Drive visit the store went
  > unregistered, the reactive `:style` threw, and Alpine wiped this inline
  > default — relighting every ring. 0.26.1 dual-guards the store registration so
  > it survives Turbo visits, restoring the fail-closed guarantee.

## 0.24.0 — 2026-07-28

The **smooth-load convention**, opt-in per app. Pages materialize behind the
current one and present themselves with a view transition — navigation renders
exactly once, with no stale-preview flash. Modifies an existing primitive:
`layouts/studio/_head` gains the convention partial and a configurable nav
spinner minimum.

**One ungated visual change on the bump, opt-in or not:** `.turbo-progress-bar`
in `engine.css` restyles every consumer's Turbo progress bar from Turbo's
default blue to the app's theme CTA color (3px, `var(--color-cta)` — defined in
both themes by the theme resolver, and the rule wins Turbo's injected-first
stylesheet cascade). Everything else is inert until an app sets
`Studio.smooth_load = true`.

### Added

- **Smooth-load convention (opt-in)** — `Studio.smooth_load` (default OFF)
  renders `layouts/studio/_smooth_load` from `_head`: the `view-transition`
  meta (Turbo 8 wraps page swaps in `document.startViewTransition`) plus
  `turbo-cache-control: no-preview`, so the next page materializes behind the
  current one and presents itself — navigation renders exactly once. An app
  with known multi-second pages should fix those before opting in (no-preview
  holds the old page until the fresh response arrives).
- **`Studio.nav_spinner_min_ms`** — the nav spinner's minimum display time,
  previously hardcoded to 2500 in `_head`. Default unchanged (2500); smooth-load
  apps typically drop it to ~300 so fast loads never linger on a spinner.
- **Smooth-load CSS in `engine.css`** — root fade-out / rise-in view-transition
  keyframes (inert until the metas render), the `.vt-pinned-header` opt-in
  utility (exactly one per page — a duplicate `view-transition-name` silently
  disables the transition), the theme-colored `.turbo-progress-bar` noted
  above, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` kill switch app e2e suites can lean on
  (`reducedMotion: "reduce"`).

### Fixed

- **`rescue_from` order in `Studio::ErrorHandling`** — `RecordNotFound` now
  resolves to `handle_not_found` (Rescuable matches last-registered first, so
  the catch-all must register first). A missing record renders a real 404 from
  `public/404.html` and **creates no ErrorLog row**; previously it was shadowed
  by the catch-all, logged as an unexpected error, and soft-404'd (302 to root)
  in production HTML. Per-host behavior changes only as each app bumps to this
  release.

## 0.23.0 — 2026-07-28

Phase D, slice 1 — the **board primitive**. The three near-identical McRitchie
Studio kanban boards (tasks / news / content) each hand-rolled the SAME SortableJS
init, the SAME optimistic move → revert → toast, and a BYTE-IDENTICAL `reorder`
controller action; the depth chart hand-rolled a within-lane variant. This slice
lifts that convergence into a neutral engine primitive, following the same seam as
the leveling modals and tricks (documented `local_assigns.fetch` locals → a
page-level Alpine factory in an `_assets` partial → capability / `fx` / event hooks
→ a `demo:` local for `/admin/style` → vendored JS).

**Purely additive — new engine files only, no existing primitive's default
changes. MS and TM render identically on the bump** (they do not use
`studio/board/*` yet; the board rebases are separate later deploys).

### Added

- **`studio/board/_board`** — the board shell: a row of columns (drop zones), an
  optional live `turbo_stream_from`, and a toast host. Documented `local_assigns`
  locals: `columns:` `card_partial:` `card_as:` `card_locals:` `reorder_url:`
  `reorder_payload:` (`:slugs` | `:ids`) `move_url:` `move_param:` `group:`
  (`false` = within-zone) `id_attr:` `zone_attr:` `handle:` `filter:`
  `zone_selector:` `draggable:` `empty_selector:` `live_channel:` `optimistic:`
  `toasts:` `empty_label:` `header_slot:` `above_board_slot:` `fx:` `on_move_hook:`
  `on_drop_hook:` `demo:`.
- **`studio/board/_column`** — one column: header + count badge + the
  `.kanban-dropzone` (`id="dropzone-<key>"`, `data-<zone_attr>`) + `.kanban-empty`
  empty state (the ZONE half of the identity contract).
- **`studio/board/_card_shell`** — OPTIONAL `render layout:` chrome that emits the
  CARD half of the contract (`id="card-<id>"`, `.kanban-card`, `data-<id_attr>`,
  `data-<zone_attr>`). Apps may hand-roll a bespoke card that satisfies the same
  contract instead.
- **`studioBoard(opts)` factory — `studio/_board_assets`.** The Alpine data behind
  the board, shipped at page level (a `<script>` cloned from a component template
  never runs), like `levelingActionModal`. ONE factory drives BOTH shapes — it
  reads `group` / `handle` / `filter` / `draggable` / `id_attr` / `zone_attr` from
  opts, so the cross-column kanban and the within-lane depth chart are the same
  code. Owns `initSortables`, `handleSortEnd` (cross-column move → PATCH →
  optimistic revert + red-ring + toast; a same-zone drop NEVER PATCHes the zone),
  `saveOrder` (reorder POST), `updateCounts`, `observeLive`,
  `installExitStreamFallback`, `animateIn`, and toasts. Preserves the
  `$nextTick` → `data-alpine-ready` init ordering (a documented flake fix). The
  primary extension seam is the dispatched window events
  `studio:board-moved` / `:board-reordered` / `:card-added` (detail
  `{ record, from, to }`) — apps LISTEN, never patch the factory.
- **SortableJS v1.15.6 (MIT) VENDORED** — `app/assets/javascripts/studio/sortable.js`,
  added to `config.assets.precompile` and loaded (deferred) by
  `layouts/studio/_head`, mirroring the vendored canvas-confetti. CSP-safe, no CDN;
  any board consumer gets `Sortable` with zero per-app wiring.
- **`Studio::Board::Rankable`** — the shared 100-gap rank read-model: a
  `board_ordered` scope (`position DESC NULLS LAST, created_at DESC`),
  `set_initial_position` (max + 100 within the zone), and `reposition!(ids, gap:,
  direction: :desc | :asc)`.
- **`Studio::Board::Reorderable`** — the shared `reorder` controller action,
  neutral param, delegating the 100-gap restamp to `Rankable#reposition!`.
- **`/admin/style` Board specimen** — the Tasks section now renders the REAL
  `studio/board/board` primitive in `demo: true` mode (drag works, no POST),
  above the static stage-palette reference.

## 0.22.0 — 2026-07-28

Two additive batches for the living style guide, converged under one release.
No existing shared primitive changes its defaults, so MS and TM render identically
on the bump.

Modal convergence, Phase 3: homes Turf Monster's quest/leveling activity modals
(change username + the quest flows) as engine primitives, each supporting BOTH
modes behind the `:leveling` capability flag. Plus a Tricks batch: three
celebration/attention effects lifted from Turf Monster into engine primitives, all
demoed on `/admin/style`.

### Added

- **Leveling-activity modal — `studio/modals/blocks/_leveling_activity`.** ONE
  primitive, **two modes**, decided by `Studio.feature?(:leveling)`:
  - **leveling on** — the full quest framing: a "Quest N of N" pill, and on
    success the seeds celebration (progress bar + level-up + Free Entry), composed
    from the existing `card_header` + `_seeds_bar` chrome.
  - **leveling off** — the plain action modal: just the action + Save, then a
    Saved state. No quest pill, no seeds. This is the McRitchie Studio shape (MS
    has no leveling; Turf Monster does).

  It renders a title, app-authored description, an optional single-line input
  (`input` / `input_type` / validation attrs), and a configurable CTA. Callers
  override the `leveling` gate per callsite (the style guide passes both) or let
  it default to the app flag.

- **Change-username modal — `studio/modals/blocks/_change_username`.** A named
  engine primitive and a thin specialization of `_leveling_activity` with username
  defaults (3–30 char input, the on-chain-neutral default copy, a
  `studio:username-saved` event). This is the primary migrated modal.

- **`levelingActionModal` factory — `studio/_leveling_activity_assets`.** The
  Alpine data behind both modals, shipped at page level (a `<script>` cloned out
  of a modal-host template never runs), like `ageVerifyModal`.

  **CRITICAL BOUNDARY — UI ONLY.** The actual save is an **app-supplied callback**:
  the modal POSTs to `submit_url` and reacts to a **domain-neutral** JSON contract
  (`{ status: "saved" | "needs_step" | "error" }`). Any second step some apps need
  (e.g. a managed-wallet write) is delegated **opaquely**: the engine hands the
  app-returned `challenge` blob to an app-supplied `window[finalize_hook]` and
  POSTs back the opaque `proof` the app returns — it never inspects, parses, or
  decodes either blob. No wallet taxonomy, signing, keys, or on-chain writes live
  anywhere in the engine; the custodial-vs-Phantom branch stays server-side. Turf
  Monster wires the managed-wallet write; McRitchie Studio wires a trivial endpoint
  that returns `{ status: "saved" }`.

- **Living style guide — new "Leveling activities" group.** Adds four specimens to
  the `/admin/style` Modals section — **change username** and a generic **quest
  activity** (a newsletter-join), each shown **both ways** (leveling on and off) so
  the two modes are visible regardless of the app's flag. Each demo resolves the
  save locally, wires the active-card glow, and carries an agent-ready reference.

- **`window.studioConfetti` — a zero-dependency, no-CDN confetti effect.**
  canvas-confetti (v1.9.3, MIT) is now **vendored into the engine**
  (`app/assets/javascripts/studio/canvas_confetti.js`) and shipped through the
  asset pipeline instead of loaded from a CDN — CSP-safe (same-origin `:self`),
  zero per-app dependency. `studio/studio_confetti.js` builds two callable
  effects on top, both honoring `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
  - **`studioConfetti.burst(target)`** — the radial card-burst that explodes from
    *behind* a card/modal, emanating from its center. Aim it with a DOM element,
    a selector, or an `{x, y}` origin (0..1 viewport space); defaults to screen
    center. Ported from turf-monster's `fireConfettiFromModal`.
  - **`studioConfetti.cannons()`** — the full-screen "you joined a contest"
    celebration: a center burst plus left + right side-cannons firing inward.
    Same choreography as the engine head's `window.fireSuccessConfetti`.

- **`.pulse-cta` — an attention pulse/glow for a CTA button**
  (`engine-motion.css`). A gentle scale + expanding fading ring on a loop, themed
  off the CTA role token (`--pulse-cta-color`, default `--color-cta`) so it
  restyles per app, reduced-motion aware. Ported from turf-monster's
  "Change Username" quest CTA (`.quest-pulse`). Named `.pulse-cta` (not
  `.btn-pulse`) so it stays a plain motion-layer effect, not a `.btn` component
  variant the `engine.css` contract would demand.

- **Three `/admin/style` Tricks specimens** — a "Confetti & pulse" group renders
  all three live: a "Fire burst" and "Fire cannons" demo (each surfacing the
  `window.studioConfetti.*` call name + a copyable snippet) and the `.pulse-cta`
  button.

### Changed

- The engine head (`layouts/studio/_head.html.erb`) now loads the **vendored**
  canvas-confetti via `javascript_include_tag` rather than the jsDelivr CDN.
  `window.fireSuccessConfetti` is unchanged and rides the same global — behavior
  is identical, only the script source moves from CDN to a bundled engine asset.

## 0.21.0 — 2026-07-27

Phase 2 of the studio-engine modal convergence: homes the entry-time age-gate DOB
modal as a policy-free engine primitive, and documents the app-specific entry-token
purchase flow as a living-style-guide specimen.

### Added

- **Age-gate DOB modal — `studio/modals/blocks/_age_verify`.** The entry-time
  date-of-birth gate (Month / Day / Year + a live "too young" hint + submit),
  homed in the engine as the heavier sibling of the existing
  `studio/modals/shared/_age_attestation` checkbox. **Run one or the other:** the
  attestation is a signup-time "I confirm I'm of legal age" checkbox; this is an
  entry-time DOB gate a server can recompute and stamp.

  **The engine hardcodes NO legal policy** — the whole seam is app-supplied:
  `min_age` (REQUIRED, with **no engine default** — 18 is itself a policy value),
  `submit_url` (the app owns the authoritative recompute + DOB persistence),
  `state` (an optional PASSIVE jurisdiction label — the modal never detects
  geography and never offers an editable state field, so a spoofed client state
  can't lower the bar), and `fine_print` (the app's per-jurisdiction legal copy;
  the engine ships only a neutral, policy-free default). The per-state age table
  that the app's policy encodes never enters the engine.

- **`ageVerifyModal` factory — `studio/_age_verify_assets`.** The Alpine data for
  the DOB modal, shipped at page level (a `<script>` cloned out of a modal-host
  template never runs). A consumer renders it once in its layout, like the shared
  alpine factories; mirrors how `studio/_cropper_assets` homes `cropPhotoModal`.
  The factory carries zero policy — no age default, no state table; the client
  age math is UX only, the server recompute stays authoritative.

- **Living style guide — new "Eligibility & entry" group.** Adds two specimens to
  the `/admin/style` Modals section:
  - The **age-gate** specimen, opened with a clearly-labelled DEMO policy (21+ in
    CA) that documents the app-supplied seam, gated by
    `Studio.feature?(:age_gate)` — disabled-but-present-yet-openable when off,
    like the web3 specimens.
  - The **entry-tokens** specimen — the app-specific purchase flow
    (picker → confirming → minted) documented by composing engine chrome
    (`shell`, `card_header`, `progress_pill`) with illustrative demo packs. The
    engine does NOT own the packs, pricing, rails, or the on-chain mint. The copy
    reflects the real on-chain model: an entry token is a **prepaid entry credit
    recorded on-chain** (not a wallet-held SPL token), **minted server-side** once
    payment clears and **consumed** when the app's hold-to-confirm creates the
    entry.

### Capability gating

- **`:age_gate`** — a new, independent capability flag gating the age-gate
  specimen (and the intended consumer mount). Off by default; a consumer opts in
  via `config.features`.

### Unchanged

- Backward compatible: every addition is additive/optional. Nothing existing
  changes behaviour, and the lighter `_age_attestation` checkbox is untouched.

## 0.20.0 — 2026-07-27

Phase 1 of the studio-engine modal convergence: the engine now OWNS the wallet
brand icons, homes the entry-confirmed celebration, and gates the web3/leveling
enrichments behind the two independent capability flags.

### Added

- **Wallet brand icons ship inline from the engine** — new
  `studio/modals/blocks/_wallet_brand_sprite` emits a hidden inline-SVG sprite
  with the Phantom (purple ghost), Solflare (yellow S), and Backpack (red pack)
  marks as `<symbol>`s. The Connect-wallet picker resolves a mark by name
  (`brandIcon(name)` → `<use href="#se-wallet-…">`) and falls back to a letter
  tile only for an unknown wallet. Every consumer inherits crisp brand icons
  with **zero per-app asset files** — before this, the picker referenced
  app-served PNGs (`/wallet-phantom.png`, …), so a fresh app that had not copied
  those into its own `public/` showed 404 letter tiles.

- **Entry-confirmed celebration — `studio/modals/blocks/_entry_confirmed`.** The
  canonical "you're in" card, homed in the engine and composed via the
  `_success_card` **yield slot**: `_success_card` owns the web3 spine (the `:lg`
  check header, branded Solana tx link, drain CTA with auto-redirect, confetti),
  and `_entry_confirmed` injects the leveling enrichment into its block. All
  numbers are **app-supplied** via Alpine expressions (default `props.*`):
  `txSignature`, `lobbyUrl`, `seedsEarned`, `seedsTotal`. Turf-specific copy is
  parameterized, not baked in.

- **Seeds progress bar — `studio/modals/blocks/_seeds_bar` + `_digit_reel`.**
  Ported from Turf Monster and generalized: the animated 5-segment fill with a
  4-phase level-up sequence (fill → level pop → drain → refill) and the
  rolling-digit counter. The `--bar-progress` registered custom property,
  `.seeds-bar-continuous`, `.seeds-reel-track`, and the `seedsShimmer` keyframe
  ship in `engine-motion.css`. Motion is class-owned (timing via a
  `--seeds-fill-dur` knob) so `prefers-reduced-motion` actually cancels the
  bar-fill, shimmer, and reel.

- **Free Entry Earned modal — `studio/modals/blocks/_free_entry_earned`.** The
  standalone level-up reward modal, parameterized (store, icon, title, copy).

- **Living style guide** gains an engine-owned wallet-icon picker, an
  "Entry confirmed" (web3) specimen, and "Entry + seeds level-up" +
  "Free Entry Earned" (leveling) specimens, so the gated variants demo correctly
  (generic-success vs seeds vs free-entry).

### Capability gating

- **`:web3`** gates the generic entry-confirmed success (branded tx link +
  heading + CTA), alongside the existing wallet / on-chain / deposit modals.
- **`:leveling`** — independent of `:web3` — gates the seeds bar and the Free
  Entry Earned reward. `_entry_confirmed` self-gates its block on
  `Studio.feature?(:leveling)`, so a **web3-only app (leveling off) gets the
  clean success card automatically** — no seeds, no free entry.

### Unchanged

- Backward compatible: every addition is additive/optional (new locals default
  to today's behavior). The shared `_success_card`, `_card_header`,
  `_cta_redirect`, and the other blocks are untouched in default behavior, so
  existing McRitchie Studio and Turf Monster consumers render identically. No
  engine view-primitive gains any signing / key material — signing stays an
  app-supplied callback seam.

## 0.19.0 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **`GET /_studio/local_review` — the local half of the board's WAITING APPROVAL
  button.** A magic link signs the recipient into the app that MINTED it: the
  token lives in that app's store, and `return_to` is sanitized to a same-origin
  PATH. So a link minted by the production task board could only ever land on
  production — the operator clicked "review this locally" and arrived, signed in,
  on `mcritchie.studio`. The board now redirects here instead, to the local
  server named by the task's `local_url`, which mints in its OWN database and
  lands the operator signed-in on the page under review
  (`?email=<who>&return_to=<path>`).

  Like the local email inbox it sits beside, this is a developer-desk tool that
  hands out sign-in material without authenticating anyone, so it is bound to the
  same floor: the route is drawn outside production only, and every request is
  re-checked against `Studio.local_tool_enabled?` — production or non-loopback
  gets a bare 404.

### Changed

- **`Studio.local_tool_enabled?(request_local:)`** — one spelling of the
  developer-desk floor (not production, loopback only), now shared by
  `Studio::LocalEmailsController` and `Studio::LocalReviewsController` so a tool
  added later cannot quietly ship a weaker gate.

- **`Studio::MagicLinkIssuing`** — the mint (`issue_magic_link`) and the URL that
  consumes it (`magic_link_url_for`) are two halves of one decision
  (`Studio.magic_link_store`), extracted from `MagicLinksController` and
  `UserMailer` into a shared concern. Handing out the wrong URL for the store
  yields "invalid or expired" on a link that was valid; they can no longer drift
  apart. No behavior change for either existing caller.

## 0.18.0 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Capability features — `Studio.features` / `Studio.feature?(name)`.** A new
  coarse app-capability switch mirroring the `auth_methods` / `auth_method?`
  pattern. `mattr_accessor :features` defaults to `[]` (every capability OFF);
  an app opts in from `config/initializers/studio.rb`, e.g.
  `config.features = %i[leveling web3]`, and code gates a surface with
  `Studio.feature?(:leveling)`. Distinct from `auth_methods` (which sign-in
  methods): features gate whole product surfaces. `feature?` tolerates String or
  Symbol entries and any Enumerable, so `feature?("web3")` and `feature?(:web3)`
  agree.

- **`engine-motion.css` — four EFFECT primitives.** Beyond the seven motion
  primitives, a new visual-effect family (same design rules: plain classes,
  themed CSS-var knobs, namespaced keyframes): `.text-gradient` (gradient-clipped
  text fill), `.studio-glow` / `.studio-glow--pulse` (a soft themed glow halo,
  distinct from the animated rainbow-border `.studio-border-glow`),
  `.surface-glass` (a frosted, translucent glass panel for overlay chrome via
  `backdrop-filter` + `color-mix`), and `.conic-surface` (a slow rotating
  conic-gradient ambient wash). All themed through the role tokens; the animated
  ones honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- **`engine-motion.css` — the LEVELING family (Turf Monster's level badges).**
  The polished `.level-badge` ladder is lifted verbatim into the engine so any
  consumer with `Studio.feature?(:leveling)` ships it: the `.level-badge` base +
  `.level-badge-1 … .level-badge-10` tiers (outline starter → filled green →
  lifted/glowed/beveled → two-tone → mint → animated mint → holographic Level 10
  with the 8-stop 400% gradient), the `.level-up-pop` pop + glow burst, the
  `.nav-level-pop` nav bounce, and the `.badge-with-sheen` one-shot sheen wrapper
  (ported from TM's `@utility` to a plain class, this layer's convention). The
  tiers theme off `--color-primary-500-rgb` (emitted by `studio_theme_css_tag`)
  so they restyle per app; the fixed mint accent is a `--level-mint` /
  `--level-mint-rgb` knob (`#06d6a0` default). The port uses the modern slash
  form `rgb(var(...) / a)` throughout — fixing TM's `levelGlow`, which shipped
  the legacy `rgba(var(--…-rgb), a)` form that silently drops for a
  space-separated var. The animated tiers honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Changed

- **`admin/style` — the living style guide (renamed from `admin/design_system`).**
  The page moves to `/admin/style` (`StyleController#index`, helper
  `admin_style_path`); `/admin/design_system` now **redirects** there and keeps
  its `admin_design_system_path` helper resolving, so a shipped host sidebar link
  keeps working. Four sections reached by a sticky section nav, reordered to lead
  with the color foundation: **Theme (landing) · Modals · Tricks · Tasks**
  (anchors `#theme · #modals · #tricks · #tasks`), rendered as sibling partials
  (`_theme`, `_modals`, `_tricks`, `_tasks`).
  - **Theme** now owns "the colors": it leads with the 7 role tokens/swatches
    (moved out of the old Style section), folds in the `/admin/theme` editor, and
    keeps a live dark/light preview. Save + Regenerate now persist **in place** —
    they submit via `fetch` and `preventDefault` the navigation (the old form
    posted to `theme_settings#update`, which redirected to `/admin/theme` and
    bounced the operator off the page), the live preview stays, and the outcome
    is a toast (the shared `_flash` toast primitive). The standalone
    `/admin/theme` page's own redirect is unchanged.
  - **Tricks** (the old "Style" section) is reframed as a board of copy-paste-for-
    an-agent style tricks: each specimen surfaces its class name prominently with
    a one-click copy plus the copyable usage snippet. It keeps the Buttons /
    Surfaces-text-form / Motion / Effects groups, and its **Leveling** group now
    renders the REAL `.level-badge` tiers (all ten + a chip context + a
    `.level-up-pop` demo), gated by `Studio.feature?(:leveling)` — greyed and
    flagged "disabled-but-present" on hosts (like McRitchie Studio) with leveling
    off, never hidden.
  - **Modals** is unchanged this pass (its real modal port lands next).

## 0.17.0 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **`admin/design_system` — the living style guide (first slice).** A new
  admin-gated page (`DesignSystemController#index`, route
  `admin_design_system_path`) that renders the engine's shared UI primitives
  live in the host app's theme. The route is propagated to every consumer by
  `Studio.routes`, and the view is a bare content wrapper that renders inside
  each host's `application.html.erb`, inheriting that app's navbar + theme. This
  slice ships the **Style** section — a grouped, live gallery where each
  specimen shows the rendered primitive, its class name, and a copyable usage
  snippet: **Buttons** (`.btn` + every role variant + `.btn-sm` / `.btn-lg`
  sizes), **Surfaces / text / form** (`.card`, `.card-hover`, `.badge`,
  `.input-field`, `.empty-state`, `.label-upper`), the seven **Motion**
  primitives from `engine-motion.css` (`.studio-border-glow`, `.spinner`,
  `.loading-dots`, `.sheen`, `.ping`, `.fade-edge-*`, `.progress-meter`) each
  with tunable CSS-var knobs demonstrated, and the seven **Theme tokens** as
  swatches read live off `var(--color-*)`. Specimens use ONLY the engine's own
  classes, so a consumer that bundles `engine.css` and imports
  `engine-motion.css` styles them for real (nothing is inlined). The Modals,
  Theme, and Tasks sections are later slices.

## 0.16.0 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Motion / effect primitive layer** — a new, OPT-IN stylesheet at
  `app/assets/tailwind/studio_engine/engine-motion.css` consolidating seven
  reusable animation + visual-effect primitives that had drifted across the MS
  and TM apps: `.studio-border-glow` (mask-composite rainbow border),
  `.spinner` (one canonical border spinner), `.loading-dots` (three bouncing
  dots), `.sheen` (sweep-of-light), `.ping` (expanding pulse ring),
  `.fade-edge` (static mask-image edge fade), and `.progress-meter` (a
  dual-layer color-flip progress bar). Plain `.class` + `@keyframes` (not
  `@utility`), themed through the 7-role CSS custom properties, every knob a
  tunable CSS var. It does NOT auto-bundle: `tailwindcss:engines` only
  generates an entry for the file literally named `engine.css`, so consumers
  adopt this layer deliberately with a single `@import` (see the file header).
  App-side de-fork of the local copies is a follow-up task.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Passwordless engine login** — the stock `sessions/new` sign-in view now
  renders its method set from `auth_methods`, so a host app configured for
  passwordless sign-in gets the correct engine-shipped view with no local
  override. Fixes a 500 in the passwordless path where the view assumed a
  password field.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **CI runs the engine's own suite from a glob-derived manifest** (PR #18) —
  `bin/release-check` now derives its test manifest by globbing the tree
  instead of keeping a hand-maintained list, and a suite-guard trips if any
  test file goes unrun; bundler is set up before any other require so the
  guard's invariant holds from boot. Internal CI tooling only — no
  consumer-facing change.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Engine-shipped component CSS** — `.card`/`.btn*`/`.badge`/`.input-field`/`.empty-state` + `text-2xs`/`text-3xs` preset tokens; consumers adopt with `@import "../builds/tailwind/studio_engine";` (docs/NEW_APP_SETUP.md section 13).
- **De-forked UI primitives** — the modal host upstreams Turf's animated host (inline keyframes, `window.ModalAnimations` registry, `enterAnim`/`exitAnim` props, directional `swap()`/`advance()`; API superset of the old host — behavioral deltas listed in the README), and `components/user_nav` gains partial slots (`balance_slot`/`extra_icons_slot`/`div2_slot`) with the legacy `*_html` string locals still honored.

### Fixed

- **Theme invariants scan class attributes, not prose** — the used-classes
  invariant extracts `class="..."` / `class: "..."` contents before tokenizing,
  so a comment mentioning a `card-*`/`btn-*` token no longer trips it; the
  theme-var invariant now asserts per mode (dark AND light) instead of the
  union, so a var emitted in only one mode cannot pass.
- **Modal host review fixes** — `cardClasses()` no longer clobbers registry
  `slide` animations (the directional swap flags are guarded, so
  `enterAnim`/`exitAnim: "slide"` resolve to real classes instead of a frozen
  220ms snap); the README's behavioral-delta wording is corrected; and a
  node-executed store suite hardens the rendered modal store (cardClasses
  resolution, registry merge, animated close timing, swap races, late registry
  replacement).
- **Consumer checkout fetches full history** — the consumer-CI checkout uses
  `fetch-depth: 0` so the hub's e2e quarantine ratchet can resolve
  `origin/release` (the default depth-1 single-ref checkout left the baseline
  ref unresolvable, which is red by design).

## 0.12.1 — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Sticky table headers: skip self-pinning tables** — `shouldEnhanceTable`
  now declines tables whose header cells are already `position: sticky`
  (they pin themselves inside their own scroll container). Cloning such a
  table doubled the header, and the activation math misfired: the in-flow
  `thead` box scrolls under the nav while the sticky `th` cells stay pinned
  and visible. Upstreamed from mcritchie-studio's local copy so consumers can
  drop their forks and enable `Studio.sticky_table_headers`.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Model-page protocol (v1)** — a reusable, admin-only per-record inspector,
  drawn into every consuming app via `Studio.routes`:
  `/models/:model/:id` renders one record as pretty JSON plus a copy/paste
  rails-console command to reload it, and `/models/:model/random` bounces to a
  random record of that model. New `Studio::ModelsController` +
  `app/views/studio/models/show.html.erb` (theme-token styled, reuses the
  `components/copy_button` partial). The protocol object `Studio::ModelPage`
  ships an **empty registry** — no model is reachable until a host opts in with
  `Studio::ModelPage.register("release", Release, lookup: :slug)` in an
  initializer (mirrors the admin-models host-registry pattern; the engine never
  constantizes host models by name). Gated with `require_admin`.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **Rails 8.1 support** — widened the gemspec `rails` bound from
  `">= 7.0", "< 8.0"` to `">= 7.2", "< 8.2"`, so consuming apps can migrate to
  Rails 8.1 independently (the engine no longer pins the ecosystem to Rails 7).
  This release is the gate for the McRitchie Rails 8.1 train — `mcritchie-studio`
  and `turf-monster` can bundle Rails 8.1 only once this version is published.
  The lower bound moves to 7.2 (the oldest Rails the apps actually run) since
  Rails 8 requires Ruby >= 3.2 and the ecosystem is already on Ruby 3.3.11.

### Added
- **`test/dummy` Rails app + `test/integration/engine_rails_8_1_boot_test.rb`** —
  boots the engine inside a real Rails app and exercises its Rails-version-
  sensitive surfaces (the Railtie registration, Zeitwerk autoload wiring, the
  `Studio.routes` DSL, and the `ErrorLog` / `ThemeSetting` / `Sluggable`
  ActiveRecord models). Re-run this against any new Rails line before widening
  the bound again. The engine's full unit suite + this boot test are green
  against Rails 8.1.3 (ActiveSupport/ActiveRecord 8.1, Zeitwerk 2.8, minitest 6).

### Fixed
- `bin/release-check` now prefers the `ruby@3.3` toolchain (was pinned to the
  retired `ruby@3.1`, which cannot resolve Rails 8.1) and runs the full test
  list, including the new Rails 8.1 boot test and the previously-omitted
  `link_token` / sticky-header / admin-models-table tests.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Shared websocket / Redis primitive** (`docs/CABLE.md`) — one place for the
  setup every host app's realtime needs, extracted after a SEV-1 (a host app
  shipped an ActionCable channel with no `redis` gem and no TLS cable config; the
  broadcast raised `Gem::LoadError` — a `ScriptError`, not a `StandardError` — which
  escaped a `rescue StandardError` and 500'd every task write).
  - **`redis` is now an engine dependency** (plus `turbo-rails`), so a consuming app
    can never hit that `Gem::LoadError` again.
  - **`Studio::Redis`** — the single source of Redis connection truth for `cable.yml`,
    the `cache_store`, and Sidekiq: `.url`, `.tls?`, and `.options(**extra)`, which
    auto-applies `ssl_params: { verify_mode: VERIFY_NONE }` for Heroku's `rediss://`
    self-signed TLS (the gotcha that silently drops every broadcast).
  - **`Studio::Cable.safe_broadcast { … }`** — best-effort broadcast guard that
    catches `StandardError` **and** `ScriptError`, so a cable failure never breaks
    the caller (the exact hole that caused the SEV-1).
  - **`Studio::Broadcastable`** — model concern with safe Turbo-Streams wrappers
    (`safe_broadcast_replace_to`, `_append_to`, `_prepend_to`, `_update_to`,
    `_remove_to`) every app should broadcast through.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **`Studio::Enumeral`** — a shared, DB-backed enumeration table for the whole
  ecosystem. Every "list of fixed, labeled, colored values" (Pokémon types first;
  statuses/tiers/roles later) is rows in ONE `studio_enumerals` table, grouped by
  `category`: a stable machine `key`, a human `label`, a `color` hex, a display
  `position`, a sparse `rank` (gappy 100/200/… domain ranking — e.g. most-common
  first — distinct from display order), and `metadata` (jsonb) for
  category-specific extras. Class helpers `catalog`, `lookup`, `color_map` (one
  query → `{ key => color }`), `color_for(category, key, fallback:)`, and a
  metadata-backed `emoji` reader + `emoji_map` (decorative glyphs live in
  `metadata`, not a column); scopes `ordered` / `by_rank`; `available?` degrades
  to empty when the table isn't installed. Shipped by the gem like `Studio::Link` /
  `Studio::EmailDelivery` — reference migration `create_studio_enumerals`
  installed per app (copy into `db/migrate`). No behavior is attached: a consumer
  adopts a new category by seeding rows, no code change.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **`Studio::Link` + unified `/l/<token>`** — one short-token model + entry point
  for both single-use, expiring **magic_link**s and reusable, non-expiring
  **referral** links. Polymorphic `linkable` (optional), `metadata` jsonb (email/
  return_to/target/age_attested off the wire), nullable `expires_at`, atomic
  single-use consume. `Studio::LinkToken` holds the pure token/kind/sanitizer
  logic (unit-tested without a DB); `Studio::LinksController` dispatches by kind
  (magic → scanner-safe confirm + POST consume; referral → attribution cookie +
  redirect). `Studio::LinkConsumption` concern shares sign-in/sign-up. Reference
  migration `create_studio_links` (installed per app like `studio_email_deliveries`).
- **`Studio.magic_link_store`** (`:signed` default | `:database`) and
  **`Studio.draw_link_routes`** flags. `:database` mints `Studio::Link`s and
  emails the short `/l/<token>` (vs the legacy `/magic_link/<MessageVerifier>`);
  fully back-compatible — the default leaves existing consumers untouched.
- **Branded mailer** lifted into the engine: `layouts/branded_mailer` + a branded
  `UserMailer#magic_link` body (theme-colored button, banner-aware). Apps with
  their own `UserMailer`/`branded_mailer` still win.
- **`Studio::EmailImage`** + **`/admin/email_images`** (admin-gated) — manage the
  banner image on transactional emails (magic-link now; per-variant registry is
  the extension point). Backed by `Studio::S3` + an owner-less `ImageCache` row
  (permanent public URL, nil-safe pre-upload).

### Changed
- `ImageCache#owner` is now optional (+ reference migration to drop the owner
  `NOT NULL`), so app-global images (e.g. email banners) can be cached.

## v0.7.0 (2026-06-20)

### Added
- **`admin_model_table` helper** (`Studio::AdminModelsTableHelper`) — a shared
  shell for `/admin/models` tables (overflow wrapper, `thead`, hover rows,
  colspan empty state). Each consumer `_<key>_table` partial now declares only
  its columns via `headers:` plus a per-row block; the helper is exposed
  automatically through the `Studio::AdminModels` concern. Removes the duplicated
  table boilerplate across mcritchie-studio and turf-monster.

## v0.6.2 (2026-06-19)

### Added
- **`Studio.sticky_table_headers` opt-in** for shared sticky table headers. The
  flag defaults off and, when enabled by a consumer app, loads the engine-owned
  `studio/sticky_table_header.css` and `studio/sticky_table_header.js` assets
  from the shared Studio head partial.

## v0.6.1 (2026-06-18)

### Added
- **`components/emoji_swap` UI primitive** plus shared CSS for nav/sidebar
  emoji hover and focus transitions, including reduced-motion fallback and
  aliases for the existing `nav-emoji-*` class names.

## v0.6.0 (2026-06-16)

### Changed
- Require `tailwindcss-rails ~> 4.5` so Studio apps can move onto the
  Tailwind CSS v4 build chain together.

## v0.5.10 (2026-06-15)

### Added
- **`Studio::AdminModels`** shared controller concern plus shared admin model
  index/show shells and teams/arenas table partials. Consumer apps define their
  model registry and scopes locally, while shared pagination, team sorting,
  sport emoji display, team JSON modal payloads, and model page framing live in
  the engine.
- **Shared operator primitives** under `studio/banners/*` for non-production
  environment banners, the shared banner button, Dev Mode controls, email
  connector status, and admin impersonation banners. Consumers can render
  `studio/banners/environment` and `studio/banners/impersonation`.
- **`Studio::Impersonation`** opt-in concern for Act As session conventions:
  `true_user`, `impersonated_user`, `impersonating?`,
  `start_impersonation_session`, and `clear_impersonation_session`. Consumer
  apps still own authorization, audit logging, routes, and app-specific safety
  rules.
- **`StudioEmailDeliveryHelper#email_delivery_banner_details`** returns the
  structured connector, provider icon, send/capture state, and tooltip used by
  the shared email status button.

## v0.5.9 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **`bin/rails "email:smoke[to@example.com]"`** — shared provider smoke-test
  task that sends one direct ActionMailer message through the current transport
  and prints the app, sender, transport, delivery method, `perform_deliveries`,
  external-send status, and message id. It refuses capture/test/file modes by
  default so agents do not mistake swallowed mail for a provider proof.

## v0.5.8 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **`StudioEmailDeliveryHelper#email_delivery_banner_status`** — shared
  non-production banner status text for whether the current process sends
  external email and which transport is active (`resend`, `ses`, `capture`, or
  the ActionMailer delivery method).

## v0.5.7 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **`Studio.mailer_from_for_transport` / `Studio.marketing_from_for_transport`** —
  provider-aware sender helpers. SES-ready apps use app/domain-specific
  `MAILER_FROM` and `MARKETING_MAILER_FROM`; Resend fallback uses
  `RESEND_MAILER_FROM`, defaulting to `McRitchie Studio <team@mcritchie.studio>`
  so new apps can send during SES sandbox/presetup without verifying a second
  Resend domain.

### Fixed
- **`ses:check` / `ses:verify_domain` credential selection** now prefers
  `SES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `SES_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` before falling back to
  generic `AWS_*` credentials, keeping SES account checks separate from
  consumer app S3/ImageCache IAM users.
- **`ses:verify_domain` existing identity handling** now accepts AWS SES's
  `already exist` response wording and falls back to reading the existing
  identity.

## v0.5.6 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **`Studio.wallet_address_method` / `Studio.user_wallet_address(user)`** —
  shared wallet-address adapter for SSO/session awareness. Defaults support
  `wallet_address` and `solana_address`; apps can configure another method.

## v0.5.5 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **Local email inbox** at `/_studio/local_emails` for non-production localhost requests. It lists recent outbox rows and exposes local proof links for magic-link, email-verification, wallet-export, and email-change emails.
- **`Studio.local_email_capture?`** — shared capture switch for local/worktree stacks. `LOCAL_EMAIL_CAPTURE=1` or `AGENT_WORKTREE=1` records delivery rows without enqueueing external sends.

## v0.5.4 (2026-06-14)

### Changed
- Engine magic links are now scanner-safe: emailed links land on an inert GET confirmation page, and the token is consumed only by the CSRF-protected POST from that page.
- Added the shared `magic_link_consume_path` route helper for consumer apps using engine-drawn auth routes.

## v0.5.3 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **`Studio::Email.deliver`** — shared ActionMailer delivery entry point that uses an app-level `EmailDelivery` when present, the engine's namespaced durable outbox when installed, and raw `deliver_later` as a fallback.
- **`Studio::EmailDelivery` / `Studio::EmailDeliveryJob`** — namespaced durable delivery rows for apps that want shared audit, retry, and resend recovery without colliding with an existing top-level `EmailDelivery` model.
- **`studio_email_deliveries` migration template** — installable shared outbox table for new or migrating consumer apps.

### Changed
- Engine magic-link and passwordless signup controllers now send through `Studio::Email.deliver` instead of calling `deliver_later` directly.

## v0.5.2 (2026-06-13)

### Added
- **`Studio::MailTransport`** — shared ActionMailer transport selection for SES SMTP primary and Resend rollback.
- **`ses:check` / `ses:verify_domain`** — shared Rake tasks for SES credential and domain verification checks.
- **`bin/release-check`** — local preflight for Ruby syntax, engine unit tests, and optional gem packaging.

### Changed
- Engine release docs now describe the RubyGems flow and consumer lockfile adoption instead of the legacy git tag pinning flow.
- Runtime dependency ranges are now bounded for cleaner RubyGems releases while preserving the current Rails 7 / Solid Queue 1.x app stack.
- `resend` is declared as an engine runtime dependency so consumer apps can drop direct rollback dependencies after they bundle the release that includes `Studio::MailTransport`.

## v0.5.1 (2026-06-02)

Smooths the turf-monster adoption of the v0.5.0 auth core (turf already ships its own battle-tested auth routes).

### Added
- **`Studio.draw_auth_routes`** (default `true`) — gates the `magic_link` + `solana` route block in `Studio.routes`. An app that already defines those routes (turf-monster) sets it `false` to keep its own routes and avoid a duplicate route-NAME boot crash.

### Changed
- **`MagicLink`** re-exposes `TOKEN_KEY` + `TTL` constants (equal to the config defaults) for back-compat with consumer code/tests that reference them; behavior is still driven by `Studio.magic_link_token_name` / `Studio.magic_link_ttl`.

## v0.5.0 (2026-06-02)

Promotes the **shared authentication core** out of Turf Monster into the engine so every Studio app runs one passwordless-first auth flow. This release is the **backend** half (services, POROs, concern helpers, base controllers, mailer); the shared wallet JS + Connect-Wallet modal land with the first consumer wiring. Turf Monster is **not** on this version yet — it stays on 0.4.x until its incremental migration.

### Added
- **`Studio.auth_methods`** config (default `%i[magic_link google wallet]`; `:password` opt-in) + `Studio.auth_method?(m)`. Login/signup surfaces render a field/button per enabled method. `:password` also re-arms the `User#authenticate` contract check.
- **`Studio.magic_link_ttl`** (15 min), **`Studio.magic_link_token_name`** (`"magic_link_v1"`), **`Studio.mailer_from`** config.
- **`SessionContext`** PORO — canonical guest/web2/web3 viewer state (`mode`, `to_h` camelCase for `Alpine.store('session')`). Wallet predicates are `respond_to?`-guarded so a wallet-less app is safe.
- **`Current`** baseline (`attribute :user`) — apps needing more request-scoped state override the file.
- **`MagicLink`** service — signed, single-use (jti in `Rails.cache`), URL-safe token; token name/TTL from config.
- **`GoogleOauthValidator`** — server-side `tokeninfo` re-check (audience / email_verified / expiry).
- **`Solana::SessionAuth`** concern — Rails-session adapter over `solana-studio`'s `Solana::AuthVerifier` (nonce delete-before-verify + host binding). solana-studio is host-provided; only loaded when wallet sign-in is on.
- **Base controllers** (generic; apps override for richer flows): `MagicLinksController` (create-or-login), `SolanaSessionsController` (nonce/verify), and an upgraded `OmniauthCallbacksController` (now runs `GoogleOauthValidator`).
- **`UserMailer#magic_link`** + `ApplicationMailer` (proc `from:` ← `Studio.mailer_from`) + app-name-aware templates.
- **Routes**: `Studio.routes` now draws `magic_link_request`/`magic_link` (when `:magic_link`) and `solana_nonce`/`solana_verify` (when `:wallet`), gated by `auth_method?`.

### Concern (`Studio::ErrorHandling`)
- `set_app_session` now binds a rotating `session[:session_token]` (OPSEC-045, guarded) and resets the `:onchain` flag; `clear_app_session` wipes both.
- `require_authentication` is now **format-aware** (HTML→redirect, JSON/Turbo→401, was a blind redirect that 406'd AJAX — OPSEC-046).
- New helpers: `set_current_context`, `verify_session_token` (guarded), `onchain_session?`, `wallet_context`, `client_session_payload` (identity-only baseline; apps override to merge balances).

### Breaking / Migration
- **`User.from_omniauth` contract is now `(auth, email_verified:)`** — the engine `OmniauthCallbacksController` passes the `GoogleOauthValidator` result. Consumers using the engine callback must update their `from_omniauth` to accept the kwarg.
- Consumers enabling `:magic_link` / `:wallet` must provide the User class methods the base controllers call (`User.find_by(email:)`, `User.from_solana_wallet(addr)`), the relevant columns (`email`, `email_verified_at`, `solana_address`, optional `session_token`), and `default_url_options` for mailer link generation.

## v0.4.13 (2026-06-02)

Promotes `components/_avatar_cropper` onto the shared crop-photo modal — completing the image-upload extraction started in v0.4.12. The avatar cropper is the **deferred-form-field** counterpart to `imageUploadHost`: it stages a cropped PNG on a hidden file input + shows a round preview, and the enclosing form (signup / profile edit) submits later (vs. `imageUploadHost`, which submits immediately).

### Changed
- **`components/_avatar_cropper`** now drives its crop through the shared `crop-photo` modal (`Alpine.store('modals').open('crop-photo', { imageUrl })`) and renders `studio/cropper_assets`, replacing the old bespoke `z-[110]` overlay + direct cropper.js load + the `avatarCropper()` factory (now `avatarCropperHost()`). The parent gets the cropped Blob back via the `crop-photo-confirmed` window event.

### Integration
Consumers rendering `components/avatar_cropper` now need the v0.4.12 image-upload integration: the `crop-photo` modal registered in the modal-host block (see v0.4.12 → Integration). The partial renders `studio/cropper_assets` itself, so cropper.js + the factories load where it's used.

### Migration
Apps that kept a local override of `components/_avatar_cropper` to route it through the shared modal (Turf Monster) can **delete the override** and use this.

## v0.4.12 (2026-06-02)

Promotes the image crop-and-upload UI out of Turf Monster into the engine: a shared cropper modal, the immediate-save upload host, the loading-card-around-a-Turbo-submit helper, and the generic "saving" card. Any consumer can now add a cropped image upload (avatar, banner, logo, OG image) with one `imageUploadHost(...)` x-data plus the cropper assets partial — no bespoke JS.

### Added
- **`studio/_cropper_assets`** — cropper.js (1.6.2) CSS + JS **and** the three inline factories below. Render it on pages that can open the cropper (avatar field, banner editor); both the library and the behavior load only where an upload trigger exists. The JS rides with the page, **not** the modal host, so it works whether or not an app overrides `studio/modals/_host`.
  - `window.imageUploadHost(opts)` — x-data host for crop-then-immediate-save uploaders. `open()` (modal-as-picker) / `onFileSelected()` (native picker) → `applyCrop()` drops the Blob into a hidden form input and submits with a loading card + toast.
  - `window.submitFormWithProgress(form, opts)` — opens the `saving` card, holds ≥450ms, submits the Turbo form, then closes + toasts on `turbo:submit-end`.
  - `window.cropPhotoModal(opts)` — the crop modal's x-data factory.
- **`studio/modals/_crop_photo`** — the shared image cropper modal. Opens via `Alpine.store('modals').open('crop-photo', { imageUrl?, aspectRatio?, maxWidth?, maxHeight?, transparent?, autoCropArea?, dispatch? })`; hands the cropped Blob back via the `crop-photo-confirmed` window event.
- **`studio/modals/_saving`** — generic loading card (title from `props.title`), opened by `submitFormWithProgress`.

### Integration
Register the two modals in your `studio/modals/host` block + render the assets on each upload page:
```erb
<%# inside the studio/modals/host block %>
<template x-if="$store.modals.current().id === 'crop-photo'"><%= render "studio/modals/crop_photo" %></template>
<template x-if="$store.modals.current().id === 'saving'"><%= render "studio/modals/saving" %></template>

<%# on each page with an image upload %>
<%= render "studio/cropper_assets" %>
<div x-data="imageUploadHost({ aspectRatio: 1, filename: 'avatar.png', saving: 'Saving photo…', dismissible: true, toast: false })"
     @crop-photo-confirmed.window="applyCrop($event.detail.blob)"> … hidden form (x-ref form + fileInput) + trigger … </div>
```
Registrations live in the host **block** (the consumer's `yield` content), so apps that override `studio/modals/_host` — like Turf Monster, which has a substantially diverged host — integrate the same way.

### Migration
For an app that had its own copies (Turf Monster):
1. `bundle update studio-engine`.
2. Delete the local `crop_photo_modal.js` (+ its importmap pin / `application.js` import), the `imageUploadHost` + `submitFormWithProgress` definitions, and `modals/_crop_photo` / `modals/_saving` / `shared/_cropper_assets`.
3. Point the host block's crop-photo / saving registrations at `studio/modals/crop_photo` / `studio/modals/saving`, and the cropper-asset renders at `studio/cropper_assets`.

## v0.4.11 (2026-05-24)

Preserves non-dismissible modals (e.g. pending on-chain TX) across bfcache restore and Turbo snapshot caching. Previously, the modal host's cleanup hooks called `closeAll()` on both `pageshow.persisted` and `turbo:before-cache`, which silently dropped any `dismissible: false` modal — including the processing card a still-in-flight JS promise was expecting to resolve against. The promise's `solanaModal.success()` then no-op'd against an empty stack and the user saw nothing despite their TX landing on-chain.

### Added
- **`Alpine.store('modals').closeAllDismissible()`** — drops every modal in the stack whose `props.dismissible !== false`, leaves locked modals in place.

### Changed
- **bfcache + Turbo snapshot cleanup** now calls `closeAllDismissible()` instead of `closeAll()`. Celebratory modals still clear on return; pending-TX modals survive.

### Migration
None required — celebratory modal behavior is unchanged. Consumers relying on `dismissible: false` (turf-monster's `onchain-tx` modal) gain crash-recovery for free.

## v0.4.10 (2026-05-23)

Lets consumer apps override toast z-indexes without `!important`. Previously, `#toast-container` set `z-index: 60` via an inline `style=` attribute, which forced any consumer override to use `!important`. Same source-order problem for `.toast-page-blur` (z-index in the inline `<style>` block here loaded after the consumer's `application.tailwind.css`). Both now read from CSS custom properties with the previous values as fallback defaults.

### Changed
- **`#toast-container`** z-index moved from inline `style=` to a CSS rule reading `var(--studio-toast-z, 60)`.
- **`.toast-page-blur`** z-index now reads `var(--studio-toast-blur-z, 55)`.

### Migration
None required — defaults preserve existing behavior. Apps that need higher z-indexes (e.g. to stack above a `z-50`/`z-110` sticky navbar) can now set the variables on `:root` in their stylesheet and drop their `!important` workaround:
```css
:root {
  --studio-toast-z: 120;
  --studio-toast-blur-z: 115;
}
```

## v0.4.9 (2026-05-23)

Modal success_card upgrades — canonical "celebration" look for any modal that needs an Entry / Action / Payment confirmed card. All options additive; existing callers unaffected.

### Added
- **`_success_card` — `large_title:`** boolean. Bumps the headline from `text-lg` to `text-3xl` (the celebration look).
- **`_success_card` — `title_key:` / `message_key:`** Alpine-expression locals for live-driven headline + subtitle. Lets a card track a store as labels mutate without re-mounting (paired with the same option on `_processing_card` in v0.4.6).
- **`_success_card` — `tx_solana:`** boolean. Upgrades the tx-signature explorer link from the plain underlined-hash style to a boxed pill with the Solana brand mark (gradient SVG, three diagonal bars) on the left and a launch arrow on the right. Same `tx_signature_key` Alpine expression drives both variants.
- **`_success_card` — `cta_drain:`** boolean. When paired with `auto_redirect_url_key`, the countdown drains as a translucent overlay on the CTA button itself — no separate progress bar / "Redirecting in Xs…" text. The celebration look. Uses the new `@keyframes studio-modal-drain` defined in the host's style block.
- **`_success_card` — yield block.** Callers can pass an inline block; the card renders it below the CTA. Used by turf-monster's onchain-tx modal to slot in the seeds-bar + level-up celebration without forking the partial.

### Migration
None required. Apps that don't set the new options keep the existing default look.

## v0.4.8 (2026-05-23)

Bugfix follow-up to v0.4.7. The v0.4.7 fix removed the ERB-escape example from the doc comment, but the same comment still referenced the bug it had just fixed using literal ERB-tag characters (the words "ERB <%# %> terminates at the first %> sequence" sit inside an ERB comment that uses `%>` as its terminator — recursive footgun). The first inline `%>` ended the outer comment and the rest leaked again.

### Fixed
- **`studio/modals/host` comment leak (v0.4.6 + v0.4.7).** Rewrote the doc comment to contain zero `%` characters; ERB now sees the entire block as a single comment. No API change.

## v0.4.7 (2026-05-23)

Bugfix — modal host doc-comment was leaking into rendered pages.

### Fixed
- **`studio/modals/host` comment block terminated early.** The leading comment in `_host.html.erb` contained a worked example of the consumer render-block syntax using literal ERB escape sequences. ERB scans for the first tag-close to close the comment, and the escape sequences end in one — so the comment terminated mid-escape, leaving the rest as literal output at the bottom of every page. (See v0.4.8 — this v0.4.7 fix was itself incomplete.)

## v0.4.6 (2026-05-23)

Small follow-up to 0.4.5 — modal dismissibility opt-out.

### Added
- **`props.dismissible: false`** on a modal's props now suppresses escape-key + click-outside close. Required for flows that mustn't be interrupted mid-step — on-chain TX while a Phantom signature is pending, multi-stage withdrawals, etc. Defaults to true (existing behavior). Set per-modal:
  ```js
  $store.modals.open('onchain-tx', { state: 'processing', dismissible: false });
  // ...later, when the TX confirms:
  $store.modals.current().props.dismissible = true;  // user can now close
  ```

## v0.4.5 (2026-05-23)

Modal infrastructure — same shape as the toast system from v0.4.0. Apps render `studio/modals/host` once, then open through `Alpine.store('modals')` and compose the shared content blocks. No migration required for v0.4.4 consumers.

### Added
- **`studio/modals/host` partial.** Single shared shell that bundles the scroll-lock CSS, bfcache/Turbo snapshot cleanup, `Alpine.store('modals')` registration (stack-based), `window.StudioModals.holdAtLeast(ms)` helper, and the modal markup (z-[120] backdrop, fade-and-scale transitions, escape/click-outside/ARIA dialog). Consumer renders once in `application.html.erb` with a block that registers their app-specific content partials by id:
  ```erb
  <%= render "studio/modals/host" do %>
    <template x-if="$store.modals.current().id === 'auth'">
      <%= render "modals/auth" %>
    </template>
  <% end %>
  ```
- **`Alpine.store('modals')` stack store.** API: `open(id, props, opts)` (with `opts.replace: true` for flicker-free transitions between steps in a wizard), `close()`, `closeAll()`, `isOpen(id)`, `current()`. Auto-syncs `body.modal-open` for scroll lock. Stack-based so modals can nest (e.g. confirm-on-top-of-form).
- **`window.StudioModals.holdAtLeast(ms)` helper.** Stamps the moment a loading view becomes visible, returns `{ then(callback) }` that delays the callback by the remaining time if the operation finished before the minimum. Replaces ad-hoc `Date.now() - startedAt` arithmetic at every async-success site. Mirrors `_navSpinnerMinMs` from `_head.html.erb`.
- **Four reusable content-block partials in `studio/modals/blocks/`.** Composable building blocks any modal can render to assemble its inner content:
  - `_success_card` — icon (default green check, or any emoji), title, optional sub-text, optional Solana tx-signature explorer link, primary CTA (href or dispatched event), secondary CTA, **self-driven auto-redirect countdown** (progress bar + "Xs…" text, fires `window.location.href` at zero), and **opt-in confetti** burst via `window.fireSuccessConfetti`.
  - `_error_card` — emoji icon (default ⏳, configurable for ⚠️ / 📍 / etc.), title, message (static string or Alpine-expression key for live updates), CTA that can reload the page, dispatch an event, or be omitted.
  - `_processing_card` — spinner (sm/md/lg, three color tokens) + title + optional message. Designed to pair with `holdAtLeast` on the caller side.
  - `_progress_countdown` — standalone progress bar + countdown text. Reads display values from caller-provided Alpine expressions so externally-driven countdowns (board's `setInterval` mutating `$store.modals` props) and internally-driven ones (success card's own timer) can share the same visualization.

### Architecture
- **Content vs. blocks.** Each consumer app owns its modal *content* partials (turf-monster's `modals/auth`, mcritchie-studio's account flows, etc.) because the flows are product-specific. The engine provides the *shell* (host) and the *building blocks* (cards) because those are universal UI vocabulary.
- **Single root requirement** on modal content partials — Alpine's `<template x-if>` clones only the first root element from its content. Top-level `<style>` blocks or stray siblings are silently dropped. Bake the style inside the partial's outer wrapping `<div>` if needed.

## v0.4.4 (2026-05-20)

Sticky-navbar scroll fixes — bounce-free for every consuming app, no migration required.

### Fixed
- **Navbar scroll-collapse bounce.** A `position: sticky` navbar that shrinks on scroll changes layout above the fold; Chrome/Firefox scroll-anchoring then compensates by moving `scrollY`, which re-crosses the collapse threshold and oscillates. `_head.html.erb` now ships `body { overflow-anchor: none }`, so the navbar resize no longer drags `scrollY`. Every app that renders `layouts/studio/head` gets this automatically.
- **Navbar unscroll threshold `20 → 5`** in `_navbar.html.erb` — widens the hysteresis dead zone (5/60) so a height change can't push `scrollY` back across the lower bound.

### Added
- **`--nav-h` CSS variable.** `_head.html.erb` ships a `ResizeObserver` that publishes the page header's live height to `--nav-h` on `:root` — updated on every resize (including the collapse animation) and re-attached after Turbo navigations. Fixed/sticky elements below the navbar can position off `var(--nav-h)` instead of hardcoded px (e.g. `style="top: var(--nav-h)"`). Auto-detects the page `<header>`; no markup changes needed.

## v0.4.3 (2026-05-19)

Tier-3 fix from the turf-monster pre-prod opsec audit (OPSEC-016).

### Fixed (security)
- **`GET /sso_login` no longer mutates the session (OPSEC-016).** The action previously called `authenticate_sso_user!` directly — starting a session on a GET. GETs are not CSRF-covered and are prefetchable (`<img>`, `<link rel=prefetch>`, browser prefetch), so an XSS on any `*.mcritchie.studio` subdomain that wrote `session[:sso_email]` could have a forged `/sso_login` hit silently start a session as that user. `sso_login` now only redirects to the login page; the session mutation happens exclusively through the CSRF-protected `POST /sso_continue` ("Continue as …" button).

### Changed
- The hub's one-click SSO link to a satellite's `/sso_login` now lands the user on the satellite login page with the "Continue as …" button instead of logging them in directly — one extra click, and the GET endpoint is no longer a session-mutation vector.

## v0.4.2 (2026-05-19)

Security follow-up to v0.4.1 — closes a cross-app session-fixation surface.

### Fixed (security)
- **Removed legacy `session[:user_id]` fallback in `Studio::ErrorHandling#current_user`** (OPSEC-042). Previously, if `session[Studio.session_key]` was empty but `session[:user_id]` was present, the engine would look up the user by that ID and silently call `set_app_session(user)` — promoting an arbitrary user ID to logged-in status. Combined with the shared `*.mcritchie.studio` cookie scope, any XSS on any subdomain that wrote `session[:user_id]` became cross-app login-as-anyone. The legacy key was a Devise-era migration carrier; consumer apps no longer write to it. Removing the fallback closes the fixation surface.

### Breaking
- Any user with a stale session that still has `session[:user_id]` set but NOT `session[Studio.session_key]` will be logged out on next request. Practically: nobody, since the engine has been writing `session[Studio.session_key]` since v0.2.x.

## v0.4.1 (2026-05-17)

Pre-public-release security hardening per `SECURITY-AUDIT-2026-05-17.md`.

### Fixed (security)
- **SSRF guard in `Studio::ImageCache.cache!`** — `source_url` is now validated: rejects schemes other than http/https, blocks loopback / private / link-local IPs (incl. AWS metadata 169.254.169.254), and blocks `localhost` / `*.local` / `*.internal` / `*.lan` hostnames. Raises `Studio::ImageCache::InvalidSourceURL`. Does not defend against DNS rebinding.
- **MIME-type allowlist in `Studio::ImageCache.cache!`** — `content_type` must be one of `ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES` (image/png|jpeg|jpg|webp|gif). Raises `Studio::ImageCache::UnsupportedContentType`.
- **MiniMagick resource caps per invocation** — every resize runs with `-limit memory 256MB -limit map 512MB -limit width/height 16KP` to prevent decompression-bomb DoS.
- **Remote source size cap** — `MAX_REMOTE_BYTES = 50MB`. Raises `Studio::ImageCache::SourceTooLarge` on overage.
- **`ErrorLog.capture!` no longer stores `exception.inspect`** — Ruby's default inspect for many error subclasses includes ivar dumps that can carry secrets (API keys read into locals, request bodies). Now stores a sanitized `"#<{class}: {message[0,1000]}>"` instead.

### Changed (breaking for misconfigured users only)
- **`Studio.s3_bucket_prefix` no longer defaults to `"mcritchie-studio"`.** Default is `nil`; host apps MUST set explicitly in `config/initializers/studio.rb`. Both current consumer apps already do this — no impact in practice.
- **`Studio.UserContractError` message** now points at the correct repo URL (`amcritchie/studio-engine`, not `amcritchie/studio`).

### Added
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) — gemspec already declared MIT but the file was missing. Required for RubyGems listing.
- Gemspec author email changed from `alex@mcritchie.studio` (personal) to `studio-engine@mcritchie.studio` (project alias).

## v0.4.0 (2026-05-17)

### Changed (breaking)
- **Gem renamed from `studio` to `studio-engine`.** Repo URL is now `github.com/amcritchie/studio-engine` (was `.../studio`). Consumers must update their `Gemfile`:
  ```ruby
  # Before:
  gem "studio", git: "https://github.com/amcritchie/studio.git", tag: "v0.3.1"
  # After:
  gem "studio-engine", git: "https://github.com/amcritchie/studio-engine.git", tag: "v0.4.0"
  ```
- The Ruby `Studio` module name is **unchanged** — all call sites (`Studio.configure`, `Studio::ErrorHandling`, `Studio::ImageCache`, etc.) keep working without code changes.
- Gem entry point at `lib/studio-engine.rb` (a thin `require_relative "studio"` shim) ensures `gem "studio-engine"` auto-requires correctly without a `require:` option in the Gemfile.

### Added
- `LICENSE`, gemspec `metadata` (homepage / source / bugs / changelog URIs), `spec.description`, `spec.required_ruby_version` — getting ready for RubyGems publishing.

## v0.3.1 (2026-05-17)

### Fixed
- `Studio.validate_user_contract!` no longer checks for `User#email` (or any column-style attribute). ActiveRecord defines column accessors lazily, so they don't appear on `.instance_methods` until first record access — leading to false-positive `Studio::UserContractError` raises at boot. Only explicitly-defined methods (`authenticate`, `admin?`, `display_name`, class `find_by`) are validated. DB columns are out of scope; missing columns fail the User table migration instead.

## v0.3.0 (2026-05-17)

### Added
- **Shared stage-* badge palette.** New scheme aliases on `app/views/components/_badge.html.erb`: `stage-fresh` (blue), `stage-shaping` (yellow), `stage-structured` (mint), `stage-refined` (emerald), `stage-cohered` (violet), `stage-shipped` (emerald), `stage-closed` (gray). Consumer apps' News + Content stage helpers can now resolve to a unified palette instead of each picking ad-hoc scheme names per stage. Closes ecosystem-audit Tier 1 #2.
- **`Studio.validate_user_contract!`** + boot-time validator hook in `Engine#after_initialize`. Verifies host's `User` class responds to required methods (`authenticate`, `admin?`, `email`, `display_name`, plus class `find_by`). Raises `Studio::UserContractError` with a clear pointer to `docs/USER_CONTRACT.md` when something's missing — replaces the previous cryptic `NoMethodError` at first request. Opt out per-app with `Studio.validate_user_contract = false`. Closes ecosystem-audit Tier 2 #16.
- **`docs/USER_CONTRACT.md`** — full reference for required + optional User methods, recommended DB columns, and a minimal compliant model example.
- **Sentry fan-out from `ErrorLog.capture!`.** When the host app has loaded `sentry-ruby` (and Sentry is initialized via DSN), every `ErrorLog.capture!` call also sends the exception to Sentry with `error_log_slug` as a tag for cross-reference. Apps without `sentry-ruby` are unaffected — the call is guarded with `defined?(::Sentry)`. Closes ecosystem-audit Tier 2 #15.

### Changed
- Stage badge color schemes are additive — existing `success/danger/warning/info/violet/primary/orange/emerald/gray/neutral` schemes unchanged.

### Notes
- Both current consumer apps (mcritchie-studio, turf-monster) already satisfy the new User contract — validator is a no-op for them.

## v0.2.4 (pre-2026-05-17)

Last release before formal versioning. Consumer apps tracked `git: main` until this point. v0.2.4 is the snapshot at the previous commit `ef738ff` ("Studio::ImageCache.cache! accepts source_path for local files"). Anything before that is in `git log`.
